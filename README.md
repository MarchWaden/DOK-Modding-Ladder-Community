# DOK-Modding-Ladder-Community

This is the repository for the Deserts of Kharak community-run unofficial website.

The eventual purpose of this site is to provide ladder ranking and support for creating mods and layouts.

Currently it is under development, and its first feature is intended to be hosting of patch and layout files uploaded by users.

As the test version does not use HTTPS I recommend that you do not use the same password for this website as you do anywhere else.

This is a fan project created as a tool for the players. Please feel free to submit any requests for features that are technically feasible
and within the terms of service for the game.

Sajuuk be praised!
